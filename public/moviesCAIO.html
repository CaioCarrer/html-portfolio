<h1>My Favorite Movies Ever</h1>
<h2>The top 3 movies you'll ever need</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>This is a really cool suspense movie with Leonardo Di Caprio.<br />
Let's hope it does't get to 25 years soon.</p>

<h3>Batman The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
<p>I'm not even sure if that's the one with the joker. At least it does not have Leo so it can get older with no worries.</p>

<h3>Robots</h3>
<p>This was my confort movie as a child. I used to watch it everyday. Communism rocks!</p>
